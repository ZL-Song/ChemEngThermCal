ChemEngThermCal

This is something I did a long~~~ time ago: a calculator for chemical engineering thermodynamics.  
That is: macroscopic equation of states, vapor-liquid equilibrium (activity/fugacity), etc.

There is a binary executable in the root/bin folder, which in theory should run on any windows OS with .net framework version > 4.0. 
All projects were intended to be OOP with ~20,000 lines of C# code.

At that time, my coding and also the english were naive so please excuse.

I am solely responsible for the codes presented and I do not guarantee the correctness of the results calculated from this program.
